# Modules
Several modules are required to sustain an effective system.  
A module may be standalone, or represent a subsystem that requires a single point of bus interface (notably Power System Management).
  
To better organize the multiple projects that will be present here another layer of directories are present.
### Acoustics and Communication
- Hydrophone direction finding
- Acoustic data processing / collection
- Optical and Acoustic Communications methods
### Controller
- Main bus controller
- Interface with embedded computers (Jetsons, Pis, etc..)
### Human Interface
- Controls boxes
- Lighting systems
### Motion
- ESC Drivers
- Servo Controllers
- Motion Processing
### Power Systm
- Power conversion (DC-DC, AC-DC)
- Power monitoring
- Battery priority and failover
- Battery charging
- Power path management
### Safety
- Internal system state
- Temperature and leak monitoring
- General system watchdog
### Example
- Template Project
